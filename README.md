**Pull requests and feature requests are welcome**, just use [the githubs](https://github.com/mattvonrocketstein/ansible-roles/).

**Testing:**.   All tests are run with tox.  Afterwards, you can view the coverage results in the `htmlcov` folder.

    $ pip install tox
    $ tox


**Commit hooks**: To maintain consistent style in the library, please use the same precommit hooks as me.  To install precommit hooks after cloning the source repository, run these commands:

    $ pip install pre-commit
    $ pre-commit install

### TODO:

- [ ] Remove the fabric dep (it prevents py3 usage)
